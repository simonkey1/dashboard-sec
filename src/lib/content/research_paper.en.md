## Introduction

The modernization of electrical infrastructure in Chile has been one of the strategic priorities of the last decade, mobilizing investments exceeding **US$ 10 billion** with a fundamental commitment: to enable **clean and socially responsible energy generation** (Ministry of Energy, 2019). While "reliability" was part of the discourse, the main driver was **Grid Decarbonization** and the integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) from the north. However, citizen perception suggests persistent fragility in the **Distribution** system (Low Voltage). This document explores this contradiction.

**Preview of Results**: Analysis of 6.2 million outage records reveals that while investment in the **Transmission** segment (High Voltage) has reduced restoration times in specific areas like the great north (REDENOR Case), there is a significant "temporal decoupling": improvements in energy transport take up to three years to permeate into the **Distribution** network (Medium/Low Voltage) and the quality perceived by the user. Even more critical, a profound territorial inequality is detected where the robustness of main **Substations** clashes with the fragility of local feeders.

**Document Structure**: Below are the **Background and Theoretical Framework** (Section 1), which establishes the lens of Energy Justice and Resilience to interpret the data. The **Methodology** (Section 2) details raw data processing and case selection. The central section, **Grid Narratives** (Section 3), exposes empirical results through four paradigmatic case studies. Finally, the **Discussion** (Section 4) and **Conclusion** (Section 5) synthesize public policy implications, questioning whether our current regulatory standards are sufficient for the new climate scenario.

## 1. Background and Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Theoretical Framework: From Reliability to Energy Justice
To analyze the friction between the modernity promised by investment and the reality lived by the user, this study transcends traditional engineering to adopt contemporary theoretical frameworks linking the technical with the social. First, we use the **Infrastructure Resilience Cycle** proposed by Hollnagel (2014), suggesting that given the climate volatility of the Anthropocene, the paradigm must shift from simple "Reliability"—understood as failure minimization—to **Resilience**. This is defined as the capacity not only to absorb and recover the system after an event but crucially to *Adapt* its functioning to High Impact Low Frequency (*HILF Events*) threats. The relevance of this approach is manifest in the adaptation "lag" observed in structural works, suggesting Chilean engineering has been efficient in resistance but slow in evolutionary adaptation.

Complementarily, we integrate the **Energy Justice** framework of Sovacool and Dworkin (2015), focusing specifically on Distributive and Recognition Justice dimensions. The theory postulates that technical metrics are not neutral; the regulatory exclusion of "Major Events" from official quality calculation (SAIFI) constitutes a failure of recognition.

It is crucial to distinguish here between "normal" events and **Critical Events (Force Majeure)**. Current regulation (SEC) allows requalifying outages caused by extreme weather events (winds > 100km/h), cleaning official statistics. However, in a Climate Change context, how many of these "out of range events" will become the new operational normal? By ignoring this data in performance evaluation, the regulator builds a parallel reality that delegitimizes citizen complaints.

### 1.2 International Empirical Background
International literature offers robust precedents validating the tension between capital flows and quality indicators. OLADE investigations (2022) in eight Latin American countries have quantitatively demonstrated that increases in tariff remuneration (VAD) correlate positively with SAIDI index improvements, but with a structural time lag of one to two years. This finding provides a critical reference frame for evaluating the Chilean case: detecting three-year maturation times in projects like Cardones-Polpaico indicates institutional and technical friction superior to the regional average, requiring explanation beyond mere physical construction.

On the other hand, studies on energy poverty in the Caribbean (Garrick et al., 2020) reveal that private investment, while reducing national outage averages by up to 45%, tends to concentrate benefits in dense and profitable urban zones. This phenomenon of service quality segregation offers a mirror to interpret Chilean reality, helping explain why regions with high rurality or territorial conflict, like La Araucanía, remain stagnant in reliability levels despite general investment amounts traded in the market.

### 1.3 National Problem Statement
Chile currently faces a marked "cognitive dissonance" in its electrical sector: the coexistence of historic investment exceeding US$10 billion in the last decade with a citizen perception of extreme fragility, crystallized after the August 2024 collapse. In light of Resilience and Energy Justice frameworks, this contradiction cannot be explained solely by climate severity, but by the rigidity of a regulatory design (IEEE 1366) that, by purging failure statistics, optimizes the grid for regulatory compliance instead of preparing it for survival in the climate crisis.

### 1.4 Purpose and Research Objectives

For this research, the following structural elements have been defined:
*   **Object of Study**: Residential electricity supply quality in relation to transmission infrastructure investment.
*   **Central Concept**: *Sociotechnical Dissonance* (the gap between technological modernization and user vulnerability experience).
*   **Delimitation**: Chilean National Electrical System, period 2017-2025.

**Research Question**:
How does **sociotechnical dissonance** manifest in the relationship between transmission infrastructure investment flows and electricity supply continuity perceived by users in Chile (2017-2025)?

**General Objective**:
**Explore** how **sociotechnical dissonance** manifests in the relationship between transmission infrastructure investment flows and electricity supply continuity perceived by users in Chile (2017-2025).

**Specific Objectives**:
1.  **Describe** the quantitative gap between official indicators (regulated SAIFI) and raw outage data (*Raw Data*), to dimension the operational reality unrecognized by regulation.
2.  **Identify** territorial disconnection patterns in zones of high investment (coverage) but low resilience (continuity), using case studies in the north, center, and south of the country.
3.  **Interpret** said dissonance in light of Energy Justice principles, to propose new analysis categories integrating climate and social variables in project evaluation.

## 2. Methodology: Listening to Raw Data

To overcome "statistical hygiene", we adopt a **Multiple Case Study** design with **Mixed Methods** approach. First, we performed an exploratory quantitative analysis of *Raw SAIFI*—clean data, with noise and weather—because that is where the user's truth resides.

<!-- COMPONENT: CONCEPT_BOX -->

*Figure 1: Temporal evolution of outages and key events (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 1**: The time series reveals peaks coinciding with climatic or social events. The initial peak of **"July 2017 Snowstorm"** stands out, an event that paralyzed Santiago and appears in our raw data with similar magnitude to later events, although administratively it was "forgiven". Similarly, the persistence of massive outages in 2024—despite record investment—evidences that "institutional friction" remains valid: the system has improved in installed capacity, but not in its **dialogue with the climate** nor in the **user experience**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Methodological Disclaimer**: Given the exploratory nature of this study, the concept of *Thick Description* (Geertz) is applied here as a tool for interpreting "digital traces" and territorial contexts, and not as a traditional field ethnography with interviews. We seek to "densify" numerical data by crossing it with local narratives and climatic events. (See Annex A).

Secondly, we selected four case studies not for their amount, but for their narrative potential. Each case (Desert, Valley, Urban, Forest) tells a different story of adaptation or failure.

## 3. Grid Narratives (Results)

### 3.1 The Coquimbo Paradox (The Sleeping Giant)
The Cardones-Polpaico line (**National Transmission System, 500 kV**) was celebrated as Chile's energy backbone, connecting northern **Generation** centers with central demand. However, for three years (2019-2021), inhabitants of Coquimbo lived a paradox: while the energy "macro-highway" flowed at maximum capacity, local **Distribution** supply kept failing.

![Figure 3: Coquimbo Case](/figura3_coquimbo.png)
*Figure 3: Persistence of failures in Coquimbo post-interconnection (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 3**: The graph shows daily affected customers (Y-axis). The **amber line** marks households without light and the **shaded strip** the investment period.
Counterintuitively, the curve does not flatten immediately after works. The **initial extreme peak (January 2019)** has a clear cause: the **6.7 Mw Earthquake**.
Although the seismic event ended, **structural damage persisted over time** in **Distribution** infrastructure (poles, neighborhood transformers, and insulators), leaving a "wounded" local network that could not utilize available power from large **Transmission Substations** immediately. This **physical damage inertia** in the electrical "last mile" explains the recovery *lag*.

### 3.2 Desert Surgery (REDENOR)
In Arica, the case is opposite. Investment in REDENOR (**Zonal Transmission/High Voltage, 110/220 kV**) acted as an effective surgical intervention.

![Figure 4: Arica Case](/figura4_arica.png)
*Figure 4: Impact of redundancy in Arica (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 4**: This bar graph compares years of total affectation year by year. A clear **structural break** is observed: high bars from pre-investment years collapse to minimum levels after transmission ring closure (2020). Here technical redundancy did eliminate vulnerability, validating the thesis that in simple topologies (desert), physical investment has immediate return.

### 3.3 Southern Fury (Pichirropulli)
In the Los Lagos region, investment hit a green wall. Despite reinforcements in **Transmission Substations** like Pichirropulli (**220 kV**), failure indices in **Distribution** feeders (**Medium Voltage**) traversing forestry zones barely improved. Energy arrives robustly to the zone but fails in the final stretch to households.

![Figure 5: Company Ranking](/figura5_companies.png)
*Figure 5: Companies with highest customer affectation (Source: Own elaboration)*

**The Vegetation Factor**: As observed in the ranking (Figure 5), companies with highest affectation operate in high forestry density zones. Chilean regulation (Service Quality Technical Standard, CNE, 2020) establishes strict safety strips, but territorial reality shows constant friction between power lines and exotic forestry plantations. Falling trees on lines remain the main cause of massive outages in the south, suggesting "the problem is not the cable, it is the tree" (and the territorial planning allowing their coexistence).

### 3.4 The Perception Gap: A Question of Justice
Finally, observing the national trend:

![Figure 1: Global Time Series](/figura1_timeseries.png)
*Figure 1: Temporal evolution of outages and key events (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 1**: The time series reveals peaks coinciding with climatic or social events, not isolated technical failures. The gap between *Official SAIFI* (~4 cuts) and *Real SAIFI* visible in these peaks (~12 cuts) constitutes a **failure of recognition** (Sovacool, 2015). When authority purges these "force majeure events", it statistically erases citizen vulnerability experience.

## 4. Discussion: Toward an Ecology of Infrastructure

Findings force us to rethink the infrastructure-society relationship under the lens of the **Resilience Cycle**. We are not facing a merely technical problem of "installing more cables". We are facing a crisis of the **Adaptation** phase.

Current strategy has been to "toughen" (thicker poles). But against events like the 124 km/h winds of 2024, brute resistance is futile. Should we move toward an "antifragile" (Taleb) network, decentralized and capable of failing "gracefully" instead of collapsing catastrophically?

### The Average Trap and Investment Destiny

It is fundamental to refine causality between "investment" and "service quality". Annual reports from **National Electrical Coordinator** and **CNE** (2024) explicitly distinguish between investment in **National System** (backbone) and **Zonal Systems**. In recent proposals, proportion oscillates significantly (e.g., 47% National vs 53% Zonal for 2026), confirming "investment" is not a monolithic block.

While this data is public, attributing efficiency of every "Zonal" or "Dedicated" (mining) dollar to residential supply improvement requires granularity exceeding this exploratory study. Therefore, we grant the **benefit of the doubt**: not all "hidden" investment is inefficiency; much obeys industrial dynamics decoupled from regulated demand. However, this reinforces the hypothesis that "total amount" (US$ 10 billion) is an imperfect proxy for citizen welfare expectation.

Likewise, analyzing *lag* impact must distinguish between **Statistical Noise** and **Structural Failure**. In small projects (&lt; US$ 5 million), a one-year delay may be irrelevant. However, in mega-works like Cardones-Polpaico, *lag* is not a rounding error: it is a systemic failure exposing the country to inefficient operation costs.

Furthermore, discussion on *lag* must incorporate **Economic Cost of Delay**. There is a positive relation between project delay and final grid price. Philosophy implies the user pays today for a "modernity" arriving late to their home.

## 5. Open Conclusion

Investment in Chilean electrical infrastructure has been successful in its mission to **integrate markets**, but incomplete in its promise to **guarantee distributive justice**. The detected *lag* is not just time: it is the institutional friction of a country changing faster than its laws.

The question remains open for reader and regulator: In an Anthropocene marked by climate volatility, **will we continue designing grids for a climate that no longer exists, basing on statistics that erase events that matter most?**

The data tells us *what* happened. The answer on *what to do* is not in the Excel, but in the social pact we decide to build.

## Annex A: Methodological Glossary

For this exploratory research, the following key concepts are defined:

**1. Case Study**
Research strategy investigating a contemporary phenomenon within its real context. In this study, each region (e.g., Arica Case) is treated as a unique system of interactions between climate, infrastructure, and regulation.

**2. Thick Description**
Concept coined by Clifford Geertz for anthropology, seeking to explain not only conduct (data) but its context. In our "digital ethnography", we apply this by crossing *cold data* (power cut) with *thick context* (heatwave, social protest, territorial conflict), to give meaning to the number.
